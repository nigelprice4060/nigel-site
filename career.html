                <p><b>Rutgers Combat Robotics Team</b>- Secretary, Founding Member, Robot Team, Buisness Team</p>
                <p><b>Feb 2025 - Present</b></p>
                <p class="indent">Inspired by the hit tv show "Battle Bots," Me and my friends founded this club on the desire to bring combat robotics 
                    to our own university. Since the start of 2025, we have completed the onboarding process, become officially recognized under the
                     Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (IEEE), completed CAD work for our first robot, and much more.
                </p>
                <p class="indent">As the Secretary, I am responsible for coordination between our teams and executive board. I ensure that the buisness team 
                    and robot team are both on the same page and are on track to reach the clubs set goals. I am responsible for ensuring that our club follows the REHS saftey guidelines, 
                    which includes making sure members have the right training before using equipment and making sure our club itself has the right tools for the job.
                    Along with this I still help both the buisness and robot teams with sponsorship emails, CAD design, and more.

                <p class="indent">As a team member in the RRPL, I've worked on fabrication for the structure of our rockets. This includes
                    CAD design, fiberglass sanding, and epoxy coating to help enforce the structure. A necessary upgrade to help our team reach 90,000ft!
                </p>
                <p class="indent">Along with structures, I've also oversought development of our rocket motors. This includes mixing propellant, construction of the
                    launch casing, and more.
